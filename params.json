Decide when you want to take the vacation\r\n2. Estimate how much the vacation will cost\r\n3. Know a little bit about your own financial and credit situation\r\n\r\n--- .class #id \r\n\r\n## Step 1: Entering Your Information\r\n\r\n#### For an example lets start off with some sample Inputs.\r\n\r\n##### Below are sample inputs that reflect the actual entry fields of the app\r\n\r\n```{r}\r\nVacation_Cost <- 3000  #Cost of Vacation\r\nWeeks_till_Trip <- 25  #Weeks Until the Planned Trip\r\nCash_in_Bank <- 500    #Cash in the bank that can be used for the trip\r\nTotal_Credit <- 5000   #Total Credit from All Credit Lines\r\nCredit_Used <- 250     #Total Credit Used from All Credit Lines\r\nPct_Credit_Used <- 25  #The % of your total credit that you are willing to use for vacation\r\nWeekly_Earnings <- 500 #Weekly takehome pay after pre-tax deductions\r\nMonthly_Rent <- 1000   #Monthly rent or mortgage payment\r\nOther_Exp <- 500       #Other Monthly Mandatory Expenses\r\nPref_Budget <- 250     #How much you normally spend in a week\r\n```\r\n\r\n--- .class #id \r\n\r\n## Step 2: What is being calculated\r\n\r\n#### The app calculates your maximum weekly budget for normal spending under 3 scenarios to pay for vacation:\r\n\r\n1. Maxing out your credit card \r\n2. Using only the amount of credit you are comfortable with\r\n3. not using any credit at all for the vacation\r\n\r\n``` {r}\r\n#1)\r\nMaxOUT_Credit <- ((Total_Credit - Credit_Used) + Cash_in_Bank + Weekly_Earnings * Weeks_till_Trip - (Monthly_Rent * (12/52) + Other_Exp * (12/52)) * Weeks_till_Trip) / Weeks_till_Trip - Vacation_Cost / Weeks_till_Trip\r\n#2)\r\nComfortable_Credit <- (max(Total_Credit * (Pct_Credit_Used/100) - Credit_Used,0) + Cash_in_Bank + Weekly_Earnings * Weeks_till_Trip -  (Monthly_Rent * (12/52) + Other_Exp * (12/52)) * Weeks_till_Trip)/Weeks_till_Trip - Vacation_Cost/Weeks_till_Trip\r\n#3)\r\nNo_Credit <- (Cash_in_Bank + Weekly_Earnings * Weeks_till_Trip - (Monthly_Rent * (12/52) + Other_Exp * (12/52)) * Weeks_till_Trip)/Weeks_till_Trip - Vacation_Cost/Weeks_till_Trip\r\n```\r\n\r\n```{r echo=FALSE}\r\nResult_Summary <- if(No_Credit >= Pref_Budget) {\r\n                    \"You are in the clear. You don't have to change a thing to take that vacation.\"\r\n                 } else if ( Comfortable_Credit >= Pref_Budget) {\r\n                    \"You can afford the vacation while staying within the amount of credit you are willing to use; however, be careful not to rack up too much credit card debt.\"\r\n      } else if (MaxOUT_Credit >= Pref_Budget) {\r\n        \"You can afford the vacation, but only by using more credit than you are comfortable with. The YOLO attitude is in vogue, but be careful of the financial hole you may be digging.\"        \r\n      } else if (MaxOUT_Credit >= 0) {\r\n        \"You can barely afford the vacation. You will have to cut back your weekly budget. The YOLO attitude is in vogue, but now you are starting to get reckless.\"\r\n      } else {paste(\"Sorry you are out of luck. You would need at least $\",as.character(round(MaxOUT_Credit*Weeks_till_Trip,2)), \" of additional credit while cutting your weekly spending to $0 to make this remotely possibility. If you are thinking that way your money might be better spent at a psychiotrists office. Keep dreaming, but you need to make some big changes before you can take this one on.\") }\r\n```\r\n\r\n--- .class #id \r\n\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Explaining the results\r\n\r\n#### Here you can see what the output of the app will be given the previous inputs\r\n\r\n1.
